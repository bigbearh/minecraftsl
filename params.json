{"name":"MinecraftSL","body":"## MinecraftSL\r\n\r\n# What is MinecraftSL ?\r\nMinecraftSL is a 3rd Party Minecraft Launcher with many 3rd party tools inside like an debug center , loading mods per launcher and a level backup utility . \r\n\r\n# When did it started ? \r\nIt started as small joke about \" Hey , I can prove that I can get away from GameMaker and code in other languages ! \" . Then I saw Minecraft . Minecraft was in Java . So 1st April 2011 was the \" birthday \" of it . \r\nThe real coding started 1st May 2011 . I started releasing the launcher with news pane and slowly with integrated options menu . That phase was named 2.0 . In that phase I learned Java on my own . \r\n\r\n# Who are you ? \r\n* Me , Maik AngelDE98 Macho , Leader of the Project \r\n* Smoolak , maker of Minecrack ( minecrack.fr.nf ) delivering our Minecrack Installer with updates for ears and capes . \r\n* Zebz , the main tester and also the man which knows how to handle with Webpages ;) \r\n\r\n# Why are you coding MinecraftSL ?\r\nIt started as - and now please don't go back to google or so to look for another launcher - launcher to play Minecraft with backup utility and one big planned ( now I think I should fix it , but it's used to be so ;) ) hole : Playing for free ( not cracked , patched , just simple \" leaked \" ! ) . The Amazon Webclouds had one small hole , showing the open world that minecraft.jar is avaible for EVERYONE . \r\nNow I want an launcher which suits every needs . Hunting bugs , errors , creating backups , launching with mods , various profiles and portable gaming , ... \r\n\r\n# How much does it cost ? \r\nI currently need no dollar , but you can donate to Smoolak @ minecrack.fr.nf or soon to us , see our \" backpage \" .  \r\n\r\n# What is the Backpage ? \r\nThe backpage is our homepage on the google servers , our \" backup homepage \" . The text content may be old but it contains the most up-to-date stable releases . It also contains the \" Bug-Answerer \" . \r\n\r\n# What is the Bug-Answerer ? \r\nThe Bug-Answerer is another utility , not bundled with MinecraftSL , made for problems with ANY launcher , mainly mod problems . It also solves the \" Thread.sleep( \" used by some modders . \r\n","tagline":"Minecraft Smart Launcher - 3rd Party Open-Source Minecraft Launcher","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
