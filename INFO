TODO : 
- Make old / decompiled classes be easier to understand and cooperate in code style .
- Work on re-implementing functions such as 
    - custom .minecraft paths ( portable gaming  , " workspace project " got removed because of instability )
    - mod-load-patcher ( implemented , not used )
- Work on proper multi-layer-LauncherPanel allowing input go thru panels down to Minecraft if not denied with given boolean in panel
    - The only cause of doing this is implementing IGM2 or modules in-game . Rendering may be enough , too .
- Remove unneeded BackupUtil methods
    - Were needed in older builds before the launch of the open-source project because of various changes , like status updates in the backup manager
